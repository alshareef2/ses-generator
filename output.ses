From the ROOTSys perspective, ROOT is made of MotorSystem!


From the MotorSystemSys perspective, MotorSystem is made of DCMotor, Ground, Monitor, PIController, SignalVoltage, Step, and Subtract!

From the MotorSystemSys perspective, DCMotor sends outPort1 to Ground as inPort1!
From the MotorSystemSys perspective, DCMotor sends outPort2 to Monitor as inPort2!
From the MotorSystemSys perspective, DCMotor sends outPort3 to Subtract as inPort3!
From the MotorSystemSys perspective, PIController sends outPort4 to SignalVoltage as inPort4!
From the MotorSystemSys perspective, SignalVoltage sends outPort5 to DCMotor as inPort5!
From the MotorSystemSys perspective, SignalVoltage sends outPort6 to Ground as inPort6!
From the MotorSystemSys perspective, Step sends outPort7 to Subtract as inPort7!
From the MotorSystemSys perspective, Subtract sends outPort8 to PIController as inPort8!
